### Introduction to Data Engineering

Data engineering focuses on designing, building, and maintaining systems that enable the collection, storage, and analysis of data. It is a critical field that supports data-driven decision-making in organizations.

Key concepts in data engineering include:
- **ETL Pipelines**: The process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a target system (e.g., a database or data warehouse).
- **Orchestration and Scheduling**: Automating and managing workflows to ensure data pipelines run reliably and on schedule.
- **SFTP Integration**: Securely transferring files between systems as part of the data pipeline.
- **Dashboards**: Visualizing data insights using tools like Streamlit.

### ETL Pipelines

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a core process in data engineering. It involves:
1. **Extract**: Retrieving data from various sources such as APIs, databases, or flat files.
2. **Transform**: Cleaning, enriching, and converting the data into a usable format.
3. **Load**: Storing the transformed data into a target system, such as a data warehouse or database.

This repository provides examples and resources for building ETL pipelines using modern tools and frameworks.

### Orchestration and Scheduling

Orchestration and scheduling are essential for automating and managing data workflows. This repository includes examples of:
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to manage complex ETL pipelines.
- **Scheduling**: Automating pipeline execution using cron jobs or orchestration tools.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring workflows are robust and can recover from failures.

### Sections and Resources

#### 1. Data Extraction
This section covers techniques and tools for extracting data from various sources, including:
- APIs
- Relational databases
- Flat files (e.g., CSV, JSON)

#### 2. Data Transformation
Learn how to clean, enrich, and transform raw data into a structured format. Topics include:
- Data cleaning with Python (e.g., Pandas)
- Data validation techniques

#### 3. Data Loading
Explore methods for loading transformed data into target systems, such as:
- Relational databases (e.g., [PostgreSQL](./sql), MySQL)
- Data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)

#### 4. SFTP Integration
This section demonstrates how to securely transfer files between systems using SFTP. Topics include:
- Setting up an SFTP server
- [Automating file transfers](./sftp)
- Integrating SFTP into ETL pipelines

#### 5. ETL Pipeline Orchestrator
Learn how to orchestrate and schedule ETL pipelines using different tools. Topics include:
- [**Python ETL**](./basic_etl): Basic programmatic pipeline
    - [**Python ETL with AWS**](./basic_etl_aws)
- [**Apache Airflow**](./airflow): A powerful workflow orchestration tool.
- [**Cron Jobs**](./scheduler): Lightweight scheduling for simple pipelines.

#### 6. Streamlit Dashboard
Build interactive dashboards to visualize data insights. Topics include:
- [Setting up a Streamlit app](./streamlit)
- Connecting the dashboard to ETL pipelines
- Visualizing data with charts and tables

### Infrastructure (Docker and Terraform)

This section focuses on infrastructure tools like Docker and Terraform, which are essential for automating and managing data engineering workflows. **Note: This section is a work in progress.**

#### 1. Docker
Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. It is widely used in data engineering for:
- Running ETL pipelines in isolated environments.
- Deploying workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow.
- Managing dependencies for data processing frameworks.

Topics covered:
- [Setting up a Dockerfile](./docker)
- Building and running Docker containers
- Using Docker Compose for multi-container setups

#### 2. Terraform
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision cloud resources in a declarative way. It is useful for:
- Automating the creation of data lakes, data warehouses, and other cloud resources.
- Managing infrastructure for ETL pipelines.
- Scaling resources for large-scale data processing.

Topics covered:
- [Basic Terraform setup](./terraform)
- Provisioning cloud resources (e.g., AWS S3, Redshift)
- Managing infrastructure as code
